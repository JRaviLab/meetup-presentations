## A Quick Intro to R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Including code chunks
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

- Check your R/RStudio versions
- For the time-being install the individual packages using `install.packages("PACKAGENAME")`
- Check out the whole `tidyverse` suite of packages [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/)


# Package installation
Install the relevant packages we will use, including our data for today, using the `install.packages()` function.

We're going to set `eval = FALSE` so that it doesn't run everytime this document is knit in Rmarkdown.

```{r tidyverse, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# data import packages
  install.packages("gapminder") # Dataset we will use today
  install.packages("here")      # Finding files
  install.packages("readr")	    # Importing data files
  install.packages("readxl")    # Importing excel files

# data manipulation packages
  install.packages("tidyverse") # Tidyverse
  install.packages("tidyr")	    # Tidy Data (part of tidyverse)
  install.packages("dplyr")	    # Data manipulation (part of tidyverse)

# data visualization and statistical packages
  install.packages("ggplot2")	  # Data Visualization (w/ Grammar of Graphics)
  install.packages("psych")     # Data visualization and stats
  install.packages("vioplot")   # Data visualization and stats
  install.packages("GGally")    # Data visualization and stats
  
```

&nbsp;

A note about `vioplot`:

If you get this message:

```{}
Error in library(vioplot) : there is no package called 'vioplot'
```

Try installing it separately through the console. Then, if you get a message that says:
```{}
Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation?
y/n: 
```

Type **y**.


### Loading packages

```{r loading, eval=T, echo=T, message=F}
# in Rmarkdown, eval needs to be true (eval=T) to load libraries below
# echo=T to show the code
# message=F to hide messages from loading the packages

library(tidyverse) # package to work with tidy data & visualization

# OR: load the individual packages:
#library(readr)    # part of tidyverse
#library(tidyr)    # part of tidyverse
#library(dplyr)    # part of tidyverse
#library(ggplot2)  # part of tidyverse
#library(purrr)    # part of tidyverse

library(readxl)   # To read Excel files
library(psych)     # has a few useful statistical functions
library(vioplot)   # to make violin plots
library(here)      # To find your files; set the working directory
library(gapminder) # Gapminder data: life expectancy, GDP per capita, population by country
```


# Data exploration
First things first, look at raw data structure. Knowing how your data looks overall will help you analyze and organize it.
```{r echo=T, eval=T}
# View(gapminder)

# Using the base r function "str" shows dataype and unique values.
  str(gapminder)
```

Compare base R to the tidyverse function `glimpse()`, which shows datatype and lists the first few rows.
```{r echo=T, eval=T}
# glimpse from `tidyverse`
  glimpse(gapminder)
```

```{r echo=T, eval=T}
# We can also look at the first 10 rows.
  head(gapminder)
```

```{r echo=T, eval=T}
# and look at the last 10 rows.
  tail(gapminder)
```
`View()` will open the dataset in a new tab.
```{r echo=T, eval=T}
# Open the dataset in a new tab.
  #View(gapminder)
```


```{r}
#If you're working with large data sets, it could be useful to take a random sample of your data to get a feel for it.

mysample <- gapminder[sample(1:nrow(gapminder), 20, replace = FALSE),]

mysample
```


If you ever need a reminder of your column names and order, use the function `colnames()`.
```{r echo=T, eval=T}
# get column names
  colnames(gapminder)
```

## Checking for missing data
Start by checking for missing data using the `summary()` function. If there are missing data points (NA), you will see them in the bottom row, but only for the variable that is missing data.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# get summary
  summary(gapminder)
```

The `describe()` function from the `psych` package gives a more detailed summary. Notice what happens with categorical variables.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# And we can compare this to 'psych' package.
  describe(gapminder)
```
A note about `attach()`: it's best not to attach; what if many datasets have the same column names?!
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# "attach" - best not to attach; what if many datasets have the same column names?!
  # attach(gapminder)
```

# Histogram: to view distributions
Plot a histogram to look at the distribution of your data.
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# histogram of life expectancy
  gapminder %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp)) +
    geom_histogram()
```

Option to try using base R.
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# histogram using base R
   hist(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

# Descriptive statistics 101
Here, we use the `summary` function again, but this time for a variable, not a dataset. This gives us a table of basic stats including minimum, median, quartiles, and min/max.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# summary for life expectancy only
  gapminder %>%
    pull(lifeExp) %>%
    summary()
```

Extract these numbers separately. 
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Use any of these to recall a single descriptor.
  max(gapminder$lifeExp)
  min(gapminder$lifeExp)
  range(gapminder$lifeExp)
  median(gapminder$lifeExp)
  mode(gapminder$lifeExp)
  mean(gapminder$lifeExp)
  quantile(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

You can also make calculations from portions of the data set.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# calculate the mean of selected samples
  mean(gapminder$lifeExp[1:10])

# we can select the rows the are from Bulgaria
  median(gapminder$lifeExp[1:10])
  
# mode does not work for the small data set because no number appears twice
  mode(gapminder$lifeExp[1:10])
```


# Summary statistics

There are many ways to get summary statistics by grouping. 

For example, if we wanted to get summary statistics of "lifeExp"" by continent:

## Using base R: `tapply()`
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
tapply(gapminder$lifeExp,
       gapminder$continent,
       summary) 
```

## Using dplyr: `summarize()`
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Note how we used 'na.rm=TRUE' to remove missing data (if needed).
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarize(mean=mean(lifeExp, na.rm=T),
            median=median(lifeExp, na.rm=T))
```

## Using purrr: `split()` & `map()`
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
gapminder %>%
  split(.$continent) %>%
  map(summary)
```

## Using psych: `describeBy()`
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
describeBy(gapminder$lifeExp,
           gapminder$continent,
           mat = TRUE)
```

In short, there are many ways to get the same information, so play around!

# Saving tables
What if we want to save the table as a file?
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# set locations for saving
  getwd()        # get working directory
  here::here()   # set working directory
  # setwd("C:/Users/Miranda Haus/Documents/RLadies_Workshops") # alternative way to set working directory

# save the table as a CSV (comma-separated values) file
  describeBy(gapminder$lifeExp,
             gapminder$continent,
             mat = TRUE) %>%
        write.csv(file="test.csv")
```

Alternatively, you can make a new variable and write it instead.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# create new variable
  test2 <- describeBy(gapminder$lifeExp, gapminder$continent, mat = TRUE)

# save as CSV
 write.csv(test2, "test2.csv")
```

# Residuals
You may or may not want to see residuals based on your experience/field/etc. Here, we can plot them in QQ (quantile-quantile) plot.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# plot residuals
  qqnorm(gapminder$lifeExp)
  qqline(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

# Plotting your statistics

Let's graph these descriptive statistics so they are interpretable by our readers (e.g. boss, reviewer, etc.).

## Making boxlots: to view distributions/summary stats/outliers

```{r eval=T, echo=T}

gapminder %>%
  ggplot(aes( y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("Life Expectancy (years)")

gapminder %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Continent") +
  ylab("Life Expectancy (years)")

gapminder %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(continent, lifeExp, FUN = median),
             y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Continent") +
  ylab("Life Expectancy (years)")

gapminder %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(continent, lifeExp, FUN = median),
             y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = T) +
  xlab("Continent") +
  ylab("Life Expectancy (years)")

gapminder %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(continent, lifeExp, FUN = median),
             y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = T) +
  geom_jitter(shape=16, position=position_jitter(0.2), size=0.5, alpha = 0.2) +
  xlab("Continent") +
  ylab("Life Expectancy (years)")
```

Here are options to try it using base R instead.
```{r eval=T, echo=T}
## Using base R
boxplot(gapminder$lifeExp)
# Or look at boxplots across group
boxplot(gapminder$lifeExp~gapminder$continent)
boxplot(gapminder$lifeExp~continent, xlab="Continent", ylab="Life Expectancy (Years)")
# You can add notches to 
boxplot(gapminder$lifeExp~continent, notch=T, xlab="Continent", ylab="Life Expectancy (Years)")
```

# Finding outliers

Now that we know what's common in our data set, let's look at what is uncommon or weird.
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# boxplot for life expectancy
  outliers_lifeExp <- boxplot.stats(gapminder$lifeExp)$out # outlier values.
  outliers_lifeExp
```

Well... lifeExp doesn't have any outliers. So let's look at a variable that does:
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# boxplot for population
  outliers_pop <- boxplot.stats(gapminder$pop)$out
  outliers_pop
```

we found them! Great! But how can I go back to my dataset to find these outliers specifically?

Let's create a subset of the data that includes only observations above our minimum outlier.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# subset of minimum outliers only
  min(outliers_pop)
  out.set <-filter(gapminder, pop >= '45598081')

# inspect
  View(out.set)
```
Now I can find the outliers and go back to my original dataset.
When would you want to do this?


# Violin plots: for seeing shape of distribution

Violin plots are more descriptive wasy to visualize box plots.They overlap distrbution and key statistics (e.g. mean, quartiles, etc.)
```{r eval=T, echo=T}
# violin plot of life expectancy
  gapminder %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(continent, lifeExp, FUN = median),
               y = lifeExp,
               fill = continent)) +
    geom_violin() +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, notch = T, fill = "white") +
    xlab("Continent") +
    ylab("Life Expectancy (years)")
```

Here are some other ways to create a violin plot using the `vioplot` package.

```{r eval=T, echo=T}
# other violplot options
  # vioplot(gapminder$lifeExp)
  # vioplot(gapminder$lifeExp ~ gapminder$continent)
```

You can also make a violin plot using the `psych` package.

```{r eval=T, echo=T}
# violin plot from psych package
  # violinBy(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

# Correlations & such

What if we want to look at how two variables interact?

Options for plotting with base R:
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# using base R
  plot(gapminder$pop, gapminder$lifeExp)
```

## Using `psych`
Using 'psych' we can plot histograms on scatterplots.
```{r eval=T, echo=T}
# histograms on scatterplots
  scatter.hist(gapminder$lifeExp, gapminder$pop)
```
Note the order of variable changes to get the same plot.

We can look at all intearctions at once.
```{r eval=T, echo=T}
# scatterplot of matrices
  pairs.panels(gapminder)
```



## Using `GGally`
This is similar to the previous function, but it takes into account the nature of the variable: numerical vs categorical.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# you may have to install GGally separately and then reload the library
  #install.packages("GGally")
  library(GGally)
# use ggally for pairs plot
  gapminder %>%
    select(-country) %>% # Removing countries from this calculation+plotting since there are too many!
    ggpairs()
```

Some notes:
- Associations that are clear:
  - Life expectancy vs. Continent
  - GDP per capita vs. Continent
- Associations that are not so clear:
  - Life expectancy vs. Population - **this requires further exploration!**


And of course, there are plenty of ways to tailor scatterplots using ggplot2 package. 
Check out all the variations below in your own time!
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# even with attach, we must still include dataset
  gapminder %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=pop, y=lifeExp)) +
    geom_point() # scatterplot
```

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Over-plotting & data is squished along pop
  gapminder %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.2) + # scatterplot w/ transparency, adjusting size
    scale_x_log10() + # log x-axis
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
    theme_bw() # simple b/w background, not the usual grey
```

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Overall correlation between population & life expectancy
  cor(gapminder$pop, gapminder$lifeExp)
```

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# What about by country?
  gapminder %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp,
               color = country, fill = country)) + # coloring by countries
    facet_wrap(~continent, scales= "free_x") + # split plots by continent
    geom_point(shape = 21, size = 1, alpha = 0.5) + # scatterplot, adjusting shape of the point, size and transparency
    scale_x_log10() + # log x-axis
    theme_bw() + # simple b/w background, not the usual grey
    theme(legend.position="none") # removing legend
```

Plotting specific countries:

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Specific countries
  gapminder %>%
    filter(country %in% c("Austria", "Bangladesh")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp,
               color = country, fill = country)) + # coloring by countries
    facet_wrap(~country, scales = "free") + # split plots by continent; independent scales
    geom_point(shape = 21, size = 1, alpha = 0.5) + # scatterplot, adjusting shape of the point, size and transparency
    scale_x_log10() + # log x-axis
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = 1) +
    theme_bw() + # simple b/w background, not the usual grey
    theme(legend.position="none")
```

Plotting for all countries:
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(corr = cor(pop, lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = corr)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "grey80") +
  geom_density(color = "blue") +
  theme_bw()
```
