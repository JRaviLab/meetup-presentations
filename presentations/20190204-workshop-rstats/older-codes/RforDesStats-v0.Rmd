## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


- Check your R/RStudio versions
- For the time-being install the individual packages using `install.packages("PACKAGENAME")`
- Check out the whole `tidyverse` suite of packages [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/)


```{install the relevant packages we will use, including our data for today.}
#eval equals false means it won't run unless
```{r tidyverse, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
install.packages("readr")	# Importing data files
# install.packages("readxl") # Importing excel files
install.packages("tidyr")	# Tidy Data
install.packages("dplyr")	# Data manipulation
install.packages("ggplot2")	# Data Visualization (w/ Grammar of Graphics)
```

### Loading packages
```{r loading, eval=T, echo=TRUE}
#eval needs to be true to load libraries below
#echo = show
library(tidyverse)
# OR load the individual packages:
library(readr)
 library(readxl)
 library(tidyr)
 library(dplyr)
 library(ggplot2)

library(gapminder)
```
```{}
View(gapminder)
```
