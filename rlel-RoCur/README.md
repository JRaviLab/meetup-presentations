@RLadiesELansing RoCur
======================

About
-----

The **[R-Ladies East Lansing RoCur (Rotating Curation)](https://twitter.com/RLadiesELansing)** is a twitter handle that will feature an awesome R-Lady each week. This account is run by R-Ladies East Lansing.

Objectives
----------

1.  To encourage and maintain Twitter engagement within the R-Ladies East Lansing community.
2.  To spotlight female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) and their great work in R.

How It Works
------------

Every week, a different R-Lady takes over our twitter account to talk about the work they do in R. Featured curators come from a diversity of professions and have a range of experiences in R, from novice to expert.

If you are interested in becoming a curator, see our *Be a Curator* section (below) and [sign up here](https://tinyurl.com/rlel-rocur).
